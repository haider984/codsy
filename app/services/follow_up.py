        Question: "{current_question}"

        A question NEEDS CONTEXT only if it contains:
        1. Unclear pronouns referring to previous items (it, this, that, them)
        2. Push/deployment commands without specifying repository name
        3. Missing essential information like specific file names, repo names that were mentioned before
        4. Continuation words implying previous work (continue, add to it, update it)
        5. Vague references like "the file", "the repo", "the project" without naming them

        A question does NOT need context if:
        1. It's a greeting, introduction, or politeness (Hi, Hello, Thank you, Please help)
        2. It contains all necessary information within itself
        3. It explicitly names files, repositories, or projects
        4. It's a standalone request or question
        5. It's a general help request

        STRICT EXAMPLES:

        NEEDS CONTEXT (YES):
        - "push the code" (missing repo name)
        - "push it" (missing repo name)
        - "create website and push it" (missing repo name for push)
        - "write html page and push" (missing repo name for push)
        - "add login to it" (what is "it"?)
        - "update the file" (which file?)
        - "continue working on that" (continue what?)
        - "fix the bug there" (where is "there"?)
        - "Add an issue: â€˜Add responsive footerâ€™ with high priority." missing project name
        - "set the priority of 1st issue of jira project as low" missing project name

        DOES NOT NEED CONTEXT (NO):

        - "Hi agent Tom, help me push code to repository named 'us'"
        - "create a github repo named myproject" 
        - "write a README.md file"
        - "Hello, can you help with Python?"
        - "Thank you for the help"
        - "Please create a login page with HTML"
        - "write html signup page and push to us repo"
        - "create a mobile shop website"
        - "Create a Jira project called Landing Site."

        Be VERY strict - only return YES if the question is genuinely incomplete without previous context.

        Respond with only "YES" if it needs previous context, or "NO" if it's complete on its own.
